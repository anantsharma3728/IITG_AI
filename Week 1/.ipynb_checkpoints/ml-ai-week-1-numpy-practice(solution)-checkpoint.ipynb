    "## What and Why NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a Python library used for scientific computing and data analysis. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is often used for tasks such as linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons **why NumPy** is a popular choice for scientific computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fast**: NumPy is written in C and is optimized for performance, making it much faster than Python's built-in data structures.\n",
    "* **Efficient memory usage**: NumPy's arrays are stored in contiguous memory, which means they use less memory than Python's built-in data structures.\n",
    "* **Broadcasting**: NumPy allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes, by automatically broadcasting the smaller array to match the larger array.\n",
    "* **Interoperability**: NumPy can easily interface with other languages, such as C and Fortran.\n",
    "* **Large collection of mathematical functions**: NumPy provides a large collection of mathematical functions for operations such as trigonometry, logarithms, and exponentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, NumPy is a powerful and efficient library that is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",

    "## From lists to numpy array\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists are very general.\n",
    "* They can contain any kind of object (or a mix of objects).\n",
    "* They are dynamically typed.\n",
    "* They do not support mathematical functions such as matrix and dot multiplications, etc. Implementing mathematical functions for Python lists would not be very efficient because of the dynamic typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays are statically typed and homogeneous. The type of the elements is determined when the array is created. Because of the static typing, fast implementation of mathematical functions such as multiplication and addition of numpy arrays can be implemented in a compiled language (C and Fortran is used). Since Numpy arrays are statically typed, the type of an array does not change once created. But we can explicitly cast an array of some type to another using the astype functions (see also the similar asarray function). This always creates a new array of new type.\n",

    "A bottlenecks in code is loops, this holds especially for python code. Compared to languages like C/C++ , Python loops are relatively slower. One reason for this is the dynamically typed nature of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python interpreter first goes line-by-line through the code, compiles the code into bytecode, which is then executed to run the program. Let's consider the code contains a section where it has to loop over a list. Being dynamically typed, Python has no idea what type of objects are present in the list (whether it's an integer, a string or a float). Further, this information is basically stored in every object itself, and Python can not know this in advance before actually going through the list. Hence, at each iteration python has to perform a bunch of checks every iteration like determining the type of variable, resolving it's scope, checking for any invalid operations etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrasting this with C, arrays are allowed to be consisting of only one data type, which the compiler knows well ahead of time. This opens up possibility of many optimizations which are not possible in Python. For this reason, loops in python are often much slower than in C, and nested loops is where things can really get slow.\n",
